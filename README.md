    Hello Judges, I hope you have had a wonderful day today. My name is Anshuman Bhamidipati, I am a rising sophomore from James B. Conant High School, and I am really delighted to present my project to you today. This is my first time participating in hackathon, especially a virtual hackathon. 
    For this hackathon, I would like to enter in all the 5 categories, which are "Best Overall", "Most Practical/Scalable", "Best Impact", "Best Original", and "Best Design". 
    The game I have created is called Package Collector. In this game the car can be controlled using the arrow keys. And the main goal of the game is to collect the packages that are scattered all over. The unique thing about this game is that the roads are continuous, which means that by driving the car off the screen, will cause the screen to switch to the next frame full of roads. The game is split into 6 separate levels and each level will have one package, which is located on one of the frames. This package needs to be collected in order to progress to the next level. 
    To start the game, load the HTML file in any browser, preferably chrome. Then click the "Start Game" button. This activates the car on the screen. By using the arrow keys the car can be moved between the frames and is used to search and collect the package. Successfully collecting all 6 packages, leads to the final winning screen.
